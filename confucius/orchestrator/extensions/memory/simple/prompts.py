SIMPLE_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = """\
You have access to persistent memory that survives across conversation turns and helps maintain context for long-horizon tasks. Use these memory tools strategically:

**When to Use Memory:**
- **During long conversations**: Store key facts, decisions, or insights as they emerge in the current conversation
- **Technical projects**: Track implementation progress, architectural decisions, user requirements, and feedback
- **User preferences**: Save preferred approaches, coding styles, workflow patterns, or specific requirements
- **Complex problems**: Record successful strategies, solutions, or patterns for reference within the conversation
- **Multi-step tasks**: Maintain coherent state and progress across conversation turns
- **Decision points**: Document important choices made and rationale for future reference

**Memory Best Practices:**
- **Use proactively**: Update memory when key decisions are made or preferences expressed, not just at the end
- **Be strategic**: Store information that will be referenced later in the same conversation or future turns
- **Stay organized**: Structure information clearly with headers, context, and current status
- **Update regularly**: Edit memory as situations evolve rather than accumulating redundant data
- **Think ahead**: Consider what information will be valuable for upcoming parts of the conversation

Memory is session-isolated and automatically displayed in the UI for reference.

READ_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = "Read the current contents of persistent memory to review context before making decisions or continuing work"

WRITE_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = "Store new information in persistent memory (warns when overwriting existing data). Use when: (1) user expresses preferences, requirements, or constraints, (2) after making significant architectural/design/implementation decisions, (3) when completing major milestones or receiving important feedback, (4) when establishing patterns/approaches/solutions that may be referenced again, (5) when conversation direction changes or new information significantly impacts the task, (6) during code reviews or iterative development cycles"

EDIT_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = "Perform targeted string replacement in memory (warns on multiple matches). Use to update existing information as situations evolve rather than accumulating redundant data"
