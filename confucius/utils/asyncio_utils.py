    Cancel a Future or Task and wait until cancellation completes.

    Behavior:
    - If the input is already done(), this is a no-op.
    - If this coroutine is itself cancelled while waiting, it preserves the
      cancellation contract by re-raising CancelledError after ensuring the
      target task has been driven to a terminal state.
    - If the task raises an exception during cancellation, the exception is
      re-raised to the caller.
    - If the task completes normally instead of cancelling, InvalidStateError
      is raised.
